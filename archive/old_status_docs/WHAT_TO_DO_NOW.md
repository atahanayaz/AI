## 📋 YOUR TODO LIST (3 HOURS OF WORK)

### Step 1: Create Documentation PDF (30 minutes)

**Open this file:**
```
documentation/FINAL_REPORT.md
```

**Do this:**
1. Copy the entire content
2. Paste into Microsoft Word or Google Docs
3. Add your names to the title page (replace [Your Name 1] and [Your Name 2])
4. Insert these 7 images where indicated:
   - part1-decision-trees/tree_visualization.png
   - part3-genetic-algorithms/fitness_evolution.png
   - part3-genetic-algorithms/best_solution_visualization.png
   - part3-genetic-algorithms/capacity_utilization.png
   - part4-fuzzy-logic/membership_functions.png
   - part4-fuzzy-logic/output_surface.png
   - part4-fuzzy-logic/contour_map.png
5. Format headings (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.)
6. Export as PDF: "Decision_Informatics_Report.pdf"

**Result:** Professional 25-30 page PDF report ✓

---

### Step 2: Create Presentation Slides (2 hours)

**Open this file:**
```
documentation/PRESENTATION_OUTLINE.md
```

**Do this:**
1. Open PowerPoint, Google Slides, or LibreOffice Impress
2. Create 18 slides following the outline exactly
3. Insert the same 7 PNG images
4. Use large fonts (24pt minimum)
5. Keep text minimal - let images speak
6. Add speaker notes from outline
7. Save as "Decision_Informatics_Presentation.pptx"

**Result:** Professional 18-slide presentation ✓

---

### Step 3: Practice Presentation (30 minutes)

**Do this:**
1. Run through slides 2-3 times
2. Time yourself (target: 12-15 minutes)
3. Practice explaining each visualization
4. Prepare answers to these questions:
   - "Why did you choose these datasets?"
   - "How did you validate your results?"
   - "What were the biggest challenges?"
   - "Could this be deployed in production?"

**Result:** Confident, polished delivery ✓

## 📁 FILES YOU'LL SUBMIT

After completing Steps 1-3, you'll have:

```
submission_package/
├── Decision_Informatics_Report.pdf (your PDF from Step 1)
├── Decision_Informatics_Presentation.pptx (your slides from Step 2)
├── part1-decision-trees/ (already done)
├── part2-naive-bayes/ (already done)
├── part3-genetic-algorithms/ (already done)
├── part4-fuzzy-logic/ (already done)
└── README.md (already done)
```

**Create the package:**
```bash
cd /home/atahan/Desktop/odevv
mkdir submission_package
cp documentation/Decision_Informatics_Report.pdf submission_package/
cp documentation/Decision_Informatics_Presentation.pptx submission_package/
cp -r part1-decision-trees part2-naive-bayes part3-genetic-algorithms part4-fuzzy-logic submission_package/
cp README.md submission_package/
zip -r submission_package.zip submission_package/
```

Then upload `submission_package.zip` to Moodle!
